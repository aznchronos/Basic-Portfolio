    <p>Hello! My name is Andy, born and raised in New York. I know I have a pretty big head, and I'm not</p>
    <p>talking about my personality, but I am Chinese after all. In regards to my ethnicity/personality, I</p>
    <p>prefer to tell people I'm a banana since I'm yellow on the outside, but white on the inside. I know</p>
    <p>there's the term "twinkie", but I prefer not being cream filled. I'm a pretty unreserved when it comes</p>
    <p>to subjects I'm passionate about (jokes, shows, games, etc), but I'm open to learning new things.</p>
    <p>Hopefully you had as much fun reading this intro as it was for me to write it!</p>
