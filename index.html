    <p class="intro">Hello! My name is Andy, born and raised in New York. I know I have a pretty big head, and I'm not talking about my personality, but I am Chinese after all. In regards to my ethnicity/personality, I prefer to tell people I'm a banana since I'm yellow on the outside, but white on the inside. I know there's the term "twinkie", but I prefer not being cream filled. I'm a pretty unreserved when it comes to subjects I'm passionate about (jokes, shows, games, etc), but I'm open to learning new things. Hopefully you had as much fun reading this intro as it was for me to write it!</p>
